    <h1>What is a Firewall?</h1>
    <p>
      A firewall is a security tool that controls network traffic, allowing or
      blocking data based on predefined rules to protect against threats.
    </p>

    <h2>A Primer on Firewalls</h2>
    <p>
      A firewall separates trusted networks from untrusted ones, filtering
      traffic to prevent unauthorized access. It can be hardware, software, or
      cloud-based. Modern firewalls offer features like deep packet inspection,
      intrusion prevention, and malware protection.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Firewalls</h2>

    <h3>Packet Filtering Firewall</h3>
    <p>
      Screens packets based on IP, ports, and protocols but lacks deep
      inspection, making it less effective against complex attacks.
    </p>

    <h3>Proxy Firewall</h3>
    <p>
      Acts as an intermediary for applications, adding security but potentially
      slowing down performance.
    </p>

    <h3>Stateful Inspection Firewall</h3>
    <p>
      Tracks connection states and blocks or allows traffic based on session
      context, improving security.
    </p>

    <h3>Web Application Firewall (WAF)</h3>
    <p>
      Protects web applications by filtering HTTP traffic to prevent attacks
      like SQL injection.
    </p>

    <h3>Unified Threat Management (UTM) Firewall</h3>
    <p>
      Combines firewall, intrusion prevention, and antivirus in a simplified,
      cloud-managed solution.
    </p>

    <h3>Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)</h3>
    <p>
      Includes advanced features like application control, intrusion prevention,
      and threat intelligence.
    </p>

    <h3>AI-Powered Firewall</h3>
    <p>Uses machine learning to detect and respond to threats in real-time.</p>

    <h3>Virtual Firewall</h3>
    <p>Software-based security for cloud and on-premises environments.</p>

    <h3>Cloud-Native Firewall</h3>
    <p>Scales automatically to secure cloud applications and workloads.</p>

    <h2>Mechanics of Firewalls</h2>
    <p>
      Firewalls analyze traffic against security policies. Stateful inspection
      tracks connections, while deep packet inspection examines data content for
      threats. Regular rule updates are vital for security.
    </p>

    <h2>Significance of Firewalls</h2>
    <p>
      Firewalls prevent cyber threats, ensure regulatory compliance, and protect
      sensitive data. Choosing the right firewall depends on security needs and
      network size.
    </p>

    <h2>Best Practices for Firewalls</h2>

    <h3>Configuring and Managing Firewall Rules</h3>
    <p>Regularly update security rules to adapt to new threats.</p>

    <h3>Regular Firewall Updates and Patches</h3>
    <p>Ensure firewalls receive timely updates to fix vulnerabilities.</p>

    <h3>Monitoring and Auditing Firewall Activity</h3>
    <p>
      Continuously review firewall logs and implement real-time monitoring to
      detect threats early.
