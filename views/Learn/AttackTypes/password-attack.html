      <h1>Password Attacks</h1>
      
      <h2>3. Brute Force Attacks</h2>
      <p>
        Think of a password as a key to unlock a door—now imagine an attacker using a battering ram instead. Brute force attacks involve systematically trying billions of username-password combinations at incredible speed. For instance, a hacker can attempt 2.18 trillion combinations in just 22 seconds. If your password is weak, your account becomes an easy target.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Ways to protect against brute force attacks:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Create strong passwords.</strong> A basic, lowercase six-character password is far easier to crack than a 10-character password that includes uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The more complex your password, the harder it is to breach.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure remote access.</strong> If your organization provides remote access, check with your IT team about security measures. Tools like OneLogin can add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized login attempts.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).</strong> With MFA enabled, even if an attacker guesses your password, they won’t gain access unless they also have your second authentication factor—such as a mobile app notification, fingerprint, or hardware token.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>4. Dictionary Attacks</h2>
      <p>
        A variation of brute force attacks, dictionary attacks exploit the common tendency to use familiar words as passwords. Hackers compile extensive lists of frequently used words, including personal details like pet names, birthplaces, or children’s names, to improve their success rate.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Preventative measures against dictionary attacks:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Avoid using recognizable words.</strong> If it’s a word you’d find in a dictionary, it shouldn’t be in your password. Instead, opt for a password manager or passphrase with random elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement account lockouts.</strong> If an account locks after multiple failed login attempts, it significantly reduces the chances of a successful attack. A reasonable limit is five or fewer incorrect attempts before requiring a cooldown period.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a password manager.</strong> These tools generate and store strong, random passwords, preventing you from relying on predictable words or phrases.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>5. Credential Stuffing</h2>
      <p>
        If an account has ever been compromised in a data breach and the password wasn’t changed, it remains vulnerable to credential stuffing. Attackers use leaked username-password pairs from past breaches to try logging into other services, assuming people reuse passwords across multiple sites.
      </p>
      
      <h3>How to defend against credential stuffing:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Monitor for data breaches.</strong> Free services like Have I Been Pwned allow you to check if your email or credentials have appeared in known breaches. Paid services offer real-time monitoring.</li>
        <li><strong>Change passwords regularly.</strong> The longer a password remains unchanged, the greater the risk of it being exploited. Frequent updates reduce this risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Utilize a password manager.</strong> Storing and generating strong, unique passwords for each account ensures that even if one login is compromised, others remain secure.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Strengthening Password Security</h2>
      <p>
        The most effective way to protect accounts from password-based attacks is to implement proactive security measures before an attack happens. Consider integrating:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Multi-factor authentication (MFA):</strong> Adding a second verification step—like a hardware key, mobile app, or fingerprint—ensures that passwords alone aren’t the sole method of access.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure remote login solutions:</strong> Identity verification tools like OneLogin authenticate users at a centralized level, reducing reliance on individual website login security.</li>
        <li><strong>Biometric authentication:</strong> Since attackers cannot easily replicate fingerprints or facial recognition data, using biometric authentication makes unauthorized access significantly more difficult.</li>
      </ul>
