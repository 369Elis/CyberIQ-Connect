      <h2>Password Attacks</h2>
<p>
  Password attacks are techniques used by cybercriminals to obtain unauthorized
  access to systems by compromising user credentials. These methods vary in
  sophistication and approach but all aim to bypass authentication barriers.
</p>

<h3>Brute Force Attacks</h3>
<p>
  Brute force attacks attempt to guess a password by trying every possible
  combination of characters. The longer and more complex a password is, the
  more time-consuming this method becomes. Automated tools can perform millions
  of attempts per second.
</p>

<h3>Dictionary Attacks</h3>
<p>
  This approach uses a list of commonly used passwords and words, often
  including variations, to guess a user's password. These lists are curated from
  leaked data breaches and common patterns.
</p>

<h3>Credential Stuffing</h3>
<p>
  Cybercriminals take username-password pairs obtained from previous data
  breaches and use them to attempt logins on other services, relying on users
  who reuse passwords across sites.
</p>

<h3>Keylogging</h3>
<p>
  Malware or hardware-based keyloggers record keystrokes to capture passwords as
  they are typed. This method doesn't require breaking encryption, making it
  especially dangerous on infected systems.
</p>

<h3>Phishing</h3>
<p>
  Attackers trick users into revealing their passwords by pretending to be
  legitimate entities via email, fake login pages, or messages. These social
  engineering attacks often exploit urgency or fear.
</p>

<h3>Mitigation Techniques</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.</li>
  <li>Encourage users to create strong, unique passwords for each account.</li>
  <li>Use password managers to help generate and store complex passwords securely.</li>
  <li>Monitor for signs of credential breaches and force resets when needed.</li>
  <li>Implement login throttling and IP-based rate limiting to block automation.</li>
</ul>
