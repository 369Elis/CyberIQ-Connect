      <h2>What is a Shoulder Surfing Attack?</h2>
      <p>
        A shoulder surfing attack occurs when an individual gains unauthorized
        access to personal information by observing someone’s screen or keypad.
        Unlike most cyber threats, this method requires the attacker to be
        physically near the target.
      </p>

      <p>
        While it can be as simple as glancing over someone’s shoulder, more
        advanced attackers might use tools like binoculars, miniature cameras,
        or other optical devices to spy from a distance. The goal is to capture
        sensitive data such as login credentials, personal details, or financial
        information like credit card numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although many shoulder surfing incidents are deliberate and malicious,
        some occur due to overly curious individuals invading privacy rather
        than intending to steal information.
      </p>

      <h2>How Shoulder Surfing Attacks Work</h2>
      <p>
        The method is typically straightforward—an attacker strategically places
        themselves to see the victim's screen and keystrokes. As the target
        enters passwords, PINs, or sensitive information, the attacker memorizes
        or records the details.
      </p>

      <p>
        Less sophisticated attackers may jot down information manually, while
        more advanced ones might employ hidden cameras or other recording
        devices to capture details discreetly.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s important to note that incidents involving skimming devices (such
        as card readers installed on ATMs) or remote access hacking don’t fall
        under shoulder surfing, as they do not require direct visual
        observation.
      </p>

      <h2>Examples of Shoulder Surfing in Action</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>ATM PIN Theft:</strong> A person discreetly observes someone
          entering their PIN at an ATM. If the victim leaves the machine without
          confirming the session has ended, the attacker can use the obtained
          PIN to conduct additional transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Public Transport Risks:</strong> In crowded places, attackers
          can easily glance at screens or overhear sensitive conversations,
          gaining access to confidential details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unattended Devices:</strong> If a person steps away from their
          unlocked laptop in a public setting after recently entering their
          password, an onlooker who has memorized the login credentials can
          access the device, potentially compromising sensitive data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Protect Yourself from Shoulder Surfing Attacks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Minimize password use:</strong> The best way to prevent
          password-based attacks is to eliminate passwords altogether by
          adopting passwordless authentication methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use privacy screen protectors:</strong> A privacy screen makes
          it difficult for anyone nearby to see your display, reducing the
          likelihood of visual eavesdropping. Some screen protectors even double
          as glass protection for mobile devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stay vigilant in public:</strong> Always be conscious of your
          surroundings, especially in busy locations. Attackers tend to target
          individuals who appear distracted and unaware.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rely on biometric authentication:</strong> Using fingerprint
          or facial recognition for authentication reduces the risk of PIN or
          password exposure, as attackers have no visible information to steal.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        While most people focus on digital threats, physical security risks like
        shoulder surfing remain a real concern. Awareness of your environment
        and proactive security measures can help protect sensitive information
        from prying eyes.
