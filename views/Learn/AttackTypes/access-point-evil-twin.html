        <h1>Evil Twin Attack: The Dangers of Fake WiFi Networks and How to Stay Safe</h1>
        <h2>What Is an Evil Twin Attack?</h2>
        <p>An Evil Twin attack is a cyber threat where a hacker sets up a fake WiFi hotspot that looks identical to a legitimate public network. Once users unknowingly connect to this fraudulent network, the attacker can monitor their online activity, intercept sensitive data, and even manipulate transactions.</p>
        <p>These attacks are particularly dangerous because anyone can execute them, even without advanced hacking skills. With tools like a WiFi Pineapple, attackers can quickly create rogue access points that mimic trusted networks in places like coffee shops, airports, hotels, and libraries.</p>

    <section class="evil-twin-how">
        <h2>How an Evil Twin Attack Works (Step by Step)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Step 1: Creating the Fake WiFi Access Point</strong> – The attacker identifies a popular public WiFi network and copies its name (SSID). Using specialized hardware, they broadcast the cloned network, making it indistinguishable from the legitimate one.</li>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Step 2: Deploying a Fake Login Page (Captive Portal)</strong> – Many public WiFi networks require users to log in through a captive portal. The attacker replicates this login page to steal credentials, email addresses, and passwords.</li>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Step 3: Tricking Users into Connecting</strong> – The fake WiFi is often stronger than the real one, making it the preferred choice for new connections. To force users off the real network, the attacker can launch a DDoS attack, pushing victims onto the fake network.</li>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Step 4: Intercepting and Manipulating Data</strong> – Since all traffic passes through the hacker's device, they can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Monitor browsing activity.</li>
                    <li>Steal login credentials for banking, email, and social media.</li>
                    <li>Modify transactions (e.g., altering payment details).</li>
                    <li>Inject malware into users’ devices.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many users remain unaware of the attack, believing they are connected to a safe network when, in reality, their sensitive data is being exposed.</p>

                <h3>Banking Fraud at a Coffee Shop</h3>
                <p> A hacker sets up a fake WiFi network in a coffee shop.</p>
                <p> A customer connects to the rogue WiFi and logs into their online banking account.</p>
                <p> The hacker modifies the transaction details, redirecting funds to their own account.</p>
                <p> The customer receives a fake confirmation receipt, unaware that their money has been stolen.</p>

                <h3>Credential Theft via Phishing</h3>
                <p> A hacker creates an Evil Twin network and redirects users to a fake login page.</p>
                <p> A victim tries to access a well-known service like Facebook or Google, but the page is actually controlled by the hacker.</p>
                <p> The victim enters their username and password, which are immediately captured and stored by the attacker.</p>
                <p> The hacker sells these stolen credentials on the dark web or uses them for identity theft.</p>

                <span class="icon">🔐</span>
                <h3>Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h3>
                <p>A VPN encrypts all your internet traffic, making it unreadable to hackers. Even if you connect to a compromised network, your data remains protected.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mitm-card">
                <span class="icon">📶</span>
                <h3>Disable Automatic WiFi Connections</h3>
                <p>Many devices automatically reconnect to familiar WiFi networks. Turn off this feature to prevent your device from accidentally connecting to a rogue access point.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mitm-card">
                <span class="icon">❌</span>
                <h3>Avoid Entering Sensitive Information on Public WiFi</h3>
                <p>Never log into banking websites, work servers, or confidential accounts on public WiFi. If you must browse, stick to general websites and avoid entering passwords.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mitm-card">
                <span class="icon">🔍</span>
                <h3>Verify Network Authenticity</h3>
                <p>Ask staff for the correct WiFi name (SSID) before connecting. If two networks have identical names, it’s a red flag.</p>
            </div>

                <span class="icon">📲</span>
                <h3>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>
                <p>Even if an attacker steals your login credentials, 2FA prevents them from accessing your accounts.</p>
            </div>

                <span class="icon">📡</span>
                <h3>Use Mobile Data Instead of Public WiFi</h3>
                <p>If possible, rely on your phone’s cellular connection rather than public hotspots. A personal hotspot (tethering) is safer than connecting to an unknown WiFi network.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mitm-card">
                <span class="icon">⚠️</span>
                <h3>Pay Attention to Security Warnings</h3>
                <p>If your browser warns of an insecure connection, don’t ignore it. Legitimate websites should always have HTTPS encryption (look for the padlock icon).</p>
