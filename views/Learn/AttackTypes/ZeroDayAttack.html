      <h1>Understanding Zero-Day Attacks</h1>
      <p>
        Zero-day attacks exploit unknown vulnerabilities before developers can
        patch them, making them one of the most dangerous cybersecurity threats.
      </p>
      <h2>What is a Zero-Day Attack?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>zero-day attack</strong> is a cyber threat that exploits a
        software vulnerability before the developer has had a chance to patch
        it. The term "zero-day" refers to the fact that security teams have
        <strong>zero days</strong> to fix the flaw before it is actively
        exploited.
      </p>
      <p>
        To fully understand zero-day threats, it’s important to distinguish
        between key terms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Zero-day vulnerability</strong> A security flaw in software
          that is unknown to the vendor and has no available patch.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Zero-day exploit</strong> The method attackers use to take
          advantage of a zero-day vulnerability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Zero-day attack</strong> The act of using a zero-day exploit
          to infiltrate a system, steal data, or cause damage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because there is no immediate fix, zero-day attacks pose a severe risk
        to businesses, government agencies, and individuals worldwide.
      </p>

    <section id="how-it-works">
      <h2>How Do Zero-Day Attacks Work?</h2>
      <p>
        Software often contains security flaws that developers work to identify
        and patch. However, if hackers discover a vulnerability before
        developers do, they can create an <strong>exploit code</strong> to take
        advantage of it.
      </p>
      <h3>🔹 How a Zero-Day Attack Unfolds:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A hacker discovers a vulnerability in software or hardware.</li>
        <li>Exploit code is developed to take advantage of the flaw.</li>
        <li>
          Attackers deliver the exploit through phishing emails, malicious
          websites, or compromised software updates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Malware infiltrates the victim’s system, allowing attackers to steal
          data or disrupt operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Security teams work to identify and patch the vulnerability, but this
          can take days, weeks, or even months.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Zero-day exploits are highly valuable to cybercriminals, often being
        sold on the dark web for large sums of money.
