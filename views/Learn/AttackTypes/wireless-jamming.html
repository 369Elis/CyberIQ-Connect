        <h1>Jamming Attacks: How Wireless Networks Are Disrupted and How to Stay Protected</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="intro">
        <h2>What Is a Jamming Attack?</h2>
        <p>A jamming attack is a type of cyber threat that disrupts wireless communications by overwhelming a network with interference signals. These attacks can target Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks, and GPS systems, preventing devices from connecting and functioning properly.</p>
        <p>One alarming example occurred in Mexico in 2020, where 85% of cargo truck thefts reportedly involved GPS jamming, allowing criminals to hijack vehicles without detection.</p>
        <p>While some jamming attacks are used in cybercrime and warfare, others can be more localized and disruptive, such as cutting off Wi-Fi signals at a party or disabling security cameras before a break-in.</p>

        <h2>How Jamming Attacks Work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Step 1: Identifying the Target Network</strong> – The attacker determines which network they want to disrupt. They research transmission frequencies and access points to choose the best interference method.</li>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Step 2: Selecting the Jamming Technique</strong> – Attackers use different interference methods, such as constant noise, deceptive signals, or reactive interference (explained below).</li>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Step 3: Deploying a Jamming Device</strong> – Specialized jamming devices broadcast strong signals on the same frequency as the target network. These devices can be purchased online or modified from standard Wi-Fi equipment.</li>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Step 4: Blocking or Manipulating Communications</strong> – Once active, the jammer prevents legitimate connections, causing:
                <ul>
                    <li>Slow internet speeds or total signal loss.</li>
                    <li>Failed GPS tracking or incorrect location data.</li>
                    <li>Dropped phone calls and blocked text messages.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

                <span class="icon">📡</span>
                <h3>Constant Jamming</h3>
                <p>✔ The attacker sends out a continuous interference signal, completely blocking network access.</p>
                <p>✔ Often used against Wi-Fi networks and military communications.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mitm-card">
                <span class="icon">🎭</span>
                <h3>Deceptive Jamming</h3>
                <p>✔ Instead of pure interference, the attacker mimics legitimate signals, tricking devices into connecting.</p>
                <p>✔ Used in GPS spoofing, where a vehicle is misled into an incorrect location.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mitm-card">
                <span class="icon">⚡</span>
                <h3>Reactive Jamming</h3>
                <p>✔ The jammer only activates when a real signal is detected, making it harder to notice.</p>
                <p>✔ Common in man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, where hackers steal data from compromised connections.</p>

                <h3>GPS Jamming and Car Theft</h3>
                <p>🚗 Criminals use jamming devices to disrupt GPS tracking on stolen cars and trucks.</p>
                <p>🚗 This makes it impossible for law enforcement to track the vehicle.</p>
                <p>🚗 Some thieves even jam electronic toll collection systems to avoid paying road fees.</p>
