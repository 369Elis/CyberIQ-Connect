      <h1>Understanding Man in the Middle (MITM) Attacks</h1>

      <p>
        A Man in the Middle (MITM) attack occurs when a malicious actor intercepts communication between two parties, either to listen in or impersonate one side. This can give the illusion of a normal exchange while the attacker quietly siphons off sensitive information.
      </p>

      <p>
        The intent behind MITM attacks is usually to gather credentials, banking data, or personal details. Typical targets include financial platforms, e-commerce systems, and login-protected services. Stolen data can be used for identity theft, unauthorized transactions, or to further penetrate secure environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think of it like someone opening your bank mail, reading your info, resealing the envelope, and placing it in your mailbox undetected.
      </p>

      <h2>MITM Attack Flow</h2>
      <p>
        These attacks typically unfold in two phases: <strong>interception</strong> and <strong>decryption</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Interception Techniques</h3>
      <p>
        Attackers may intercept traffic using malicious public Wi-Fi hotspots or by manipulating network protocols. Here are common methods:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IP Spoofing:</strong> Faking IP addresses to reroute traffic to an attacker-controlled site.</li>
        <li><strong>ARP Spoofing:</strong> Tricking a local network to associate the attacker's MAC address with a valid IP.</li>
        <li><strong>DNS Spoofing:</strong> Tampering with DNS records to send users to fake websites.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Decryption Techniques</h3>
      <p>
        Once traffic is intercepted, attackers try to read encrypted communication. Common tactics include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HTTPS Spoofing:</strong> Sending fake security certificates to trick users into trusting a malicious site.</li>
        <li><strong>SSL BEAST:</strong> Exploiting older TLS versions to capture session cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>SSL Hijacking:</strong> Forging authentication keys during handshake to monitor entire sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>SSL Stripping:</strong> Downgrading HTTPS to unencrypted HTTP so attackers can view data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Preventing MITM Attacks</h2>
      <p>
        Users and site owners can take several steps to defend against MITM threats:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid public Wi-Fi networks that lack password protection.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to browser warnings about insecure websites.</li>
        <li>Log out of sensitive services when not in use.</li>
        <li>Don’t perform financial tasks on public connections.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For websites and services, strong SSL/TLS configurations are critical. Encrypting all pages—not just login forms—helps prevent session hijacking. Features like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) further harden defenses.
      </p>

      <h2>How Tools like Imperva Help</h2>
      <p>
        Platforms like Imperva offer robust SSL/TLS management to prevent MITM exploits such as SSL stripping and weak cipher vulnerabilities. These services ensure encryption standards are current and automatically updated for compliance and protection against emerging threats.
