      <h1>Types of Email Attacks</h1>
      <p>
        Email is a widely used communication tool, making it a major target for
        cybercriminals. Various types of email attacks exploit vulnerabilities
        to steal data, install malware, and conduct fraudulent activities. Below
        are some common types of email-based cyber threats.
      </p>

      <h2>Phishing</h2>
      <p>
        Phishing attacks involve deceptive emails that impersonate trusted
        entities to steal sensitive information like passwords and financial
        data.
      </p>

      <h3>Spear Phishing</h3>
      <p>
        A highly targeted attack where cybercriminals research their victims to
        make phishing emails appear more convincing.
      </p>

      <h3>Whaling</h3>
      <p>
        Targets high-profile executives or officials, often attempting to
        manipulate them into authorizing fraudulent transactions.
      </p>

      <h2>Vishing (Voice Phishing)</h2>
      <p>
        Scammers use phone calls and voice messages to impersonate banks or
        companies, tricking victims into revealing confidential details.
      </p>

      <h2>Smishing (SMS Phishing)</h2>
      <p>
        Similar to phishing but conducted through text messages, directing
        victims to fraudulent websites or installing malware.
      </p>

      <h2>Pharming</h2>
      <p>
        Redirects users from legitimate websites to counterfeit versions,
        tricking them into entering personal data.
      </p>

      <h2>Spyware & Adware</h2>
      <p>
        Spyware monitors user activity and collects sensitive information, while
        adware displays intrusive advertisements and may carry malware.
      </p>

      <h2>Scareware</h2>
      <p>
        Fake warnings trick users into downloading malicious software by falsely
        claiming their device is infected.
      </p>

      <h2>Spam & Email-Based Malware</h2>
      <p>
        Unsolicited bulk emails that distribute malware, phishing links, and
        fraudulent schemes.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Protect Yourself from Email Attacks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Be cautious with emails from unknown sources.</li>
        <li>
          Verify links before clicking and check for unusual domain names.
        </li>
        <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.</li>
        <li>Keep your operating system and software updated.</li>
        <li>Avoid urgent requests for personal information in emails.</li>
      </ul>
