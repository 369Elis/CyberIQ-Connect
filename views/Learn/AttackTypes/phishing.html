      <h1>Phishing Attacks</h1>
      <p>
        Phishing is one of the most common and effective cyber threats, designed
        to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information such as
        login credentials, financial details, or personal data. Cybercriminals
        use various phishing techniques to exploit trust and manipulate victims
        into taking harmful actions.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Phishing Attacks</h2>

      <h2>Email Phishing</h2>
      <p>
        Attackers send deceptive emails pretending to be from reputable sources,
        attempting to trick recipients into clicking on malicious links or
        downloading malware.
      </p>

      <h3>Spear Phishing</h3>
      <p>
        A highly targeted phishing attack where cybercriminals research their
        victims to make fraudulent emails appear more convincing.
      </p>

      <h3>Whaling</h3>
      <p>
        A phishing attack that specifically targets high-profile executives or
        officials, often involving fraudulent requests for money transfers or
        sensitive business information.
      </p>

      <h2>Clone Phishing</h2>
      <p>
        Attackers duplicate legitimate emails from a trusted sender but replace
        original links or attachments with malicious versions to deceive
        recipients into interacting with them.
      </p>

      <h2>Vishing (Voice Phishing)</h2>
      <p>
        Scammers use phone calls and voice messages to impersonate banks,
        businesses, or government agencies, manipulating victims into revealing
        confidential details.
      </p>

      <h2>Smishing (SMS Phishing)</h2>
      <p>
        A form of phishing conducted through text messages, directing victims to
        fake websites or installing malware on their mobile devices.
      </p>

      <h2>Pharming</h2>
      <p>
        A cyber attack that redirects users from legitimate websites to
        counterfeit versions, tricking them into entering personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>Business Email Compromise (BEC)</h2>
      <p>
        Attackers impersonate executives, partners, or trusted individuals
        within an organization to manipulate employees into transferring funds
        or sharing confidential data.
      </p>
