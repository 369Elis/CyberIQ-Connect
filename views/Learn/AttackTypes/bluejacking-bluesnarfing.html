      <h2>Bluetooth Hacking Explained</h2>
      <p>
        Bluetooth hacking is a growing concern, with two major
        techniques—Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing—that exploit Bluetooth
        vulnerabilities. While both involve unauthorized use of Bluetooth
        connections, they differ in severity and intent.

    <section class="bluejacking">
      <h2>What Is Bluejacking?</h2>
      <p>
        Bluejacking is a relatively harmless Bluetooth exploit where attackers
        send unsolicited messages to nearby devices. It does not involve
        stealing personal data or taking control of the device. Instead, it is
        often used as a prank or marketing tactic to send texts, images, or
        sounds to unsuspecting users.
      </p>
      <p>
        A hacker performing a Bluejacking attack first scans for active
        Bluetooth devices within a short range, typically around 30 feet. Once
        they find a device, they send an unsolicited message disguised as a
        standard Bluetooth notification. The victim may receive what appears to
        be a normal contact request or message, which can be confusing or
        annoying.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, since no personal data is stolen, the primary risk is
        disruption and annoyance, rather than serious security threats.

    <section class="bluesnarfing">
      <h2>What Is Bluesnarfing?</h2>
      <p>
        Bluesnarfing, in contrast, is a serious cybersecurity attack that allows
        hackers to steal sensitive data from a device through its Bluetooth
        connection. Unlike Bluejacking, which only sends messages, Bluesnarfing
        enables an attacker to access and copy personal files such as contact
        lists, text messages, emails, and even private photos.
      </p>
      <p>
        The attack works by scanning for discoverable Bluetooth devices and
        exploiting security flaws in the protocol to bypass authentication. Once
        the attacker gains unauthorized access, they can extract private data
        without the victim noticing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, advanced Bluesnarfing attacks even allow the hacker to
        send messages or make phone calls from the victim’s device.

          <h3>Disable Bluetooth When Not in Use</h3>
          <p>
            ✔ Turning off Bluetooth prevents attackers from discovering and
            targeting your device.

          <h3>Never Use "Discoverable" Mode</h3>
          <p>
            ✔ Keeping your Bluetooth in discoverable mode makes it easier for
            hackers to find and exploit your connection.

          <p>
            ✔ Set up a unique PIN or passkey to ensure that only trusted devices
            can connect.

          <h3>Ignore Unsolicited Bluetooth Messages</h3>
          <p>
            ✔ If you receive an unexpected Bluetooth message, do not accept or
            open it—especially from unknown sources.
