    <section class="intro">
        <h2>What Is Driver Manipulation?</h2>
        <p>Driver manipulation is a cyberattack technique that targets device drivers—the software responsible for facilitating communication between an operating system and hardware components like printers, graphics cards, and audio systems. Since operating systems place a high level of trust in drivers, attackers exploit this trust to bypass security controls, escalate privileges, and gain unauthorized system access.</p>
        <p>By altering or injecting malicious code into drivers, attackers can compromise system integrity, steal sensitive information, or even take full control of a device. This makes driver manipulation a powerful method for executing advanced cyberattacks.</p>

    <section class="driver-how">
        <h2>How Driver Manipulation Works</h2>
        <p>Driver manipulation techniques allow attackers to modify, replace, or inject malicious code into drivers to execute unauthorized actions. The two primary methods used in these attacks are:</p>

                <h3>Shimming</h3>
                <p>Shimming involves inserting a small intermediary library that sits between the operating system and a legitimate driver. This shim intercepts API calls and modifies the communication process, allowing attackers to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>🔹 Alter how the OS interacts with hardware, potentially bypassing security restrictions.</li>
                    <li>🔹 Inject malicious instructions that modify system behavior.</li>
                    <li>🔹 Exploit compatibility features to run unsigned or outdated drivers with known vulnerabilities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Attackers have used Windows Application Compatibility Shims to bypass User Account Control (UAC) and elevate privileges without triggering security alerts.</p>

                <span class="icon">🔄</span>
                <h3>Refactoring</h3>
                <p>Refactoring involves modifying a driver’s code to introduce new functions or vulnerabilities. Unlike shimming, which intercepts communication, refactoring changes the driver itself, making malicious alterations harder to detect.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>🔹 Attackers alter existing drivers to create malware variants that evade detection.</li>
                    <li>🔹 They modify the way drivers handle system requests, potentially granting unauthorized access.</li>
                    <li>🔹 Refactored drivers can be digitally signed, tricking the system into trusting them.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Some malware campaigns have used signed but altered drivers to deploy rootkits, allowing deep-level system access while remaining undetected by security software.</p>

    <section class="driver-examples">
        <h2>Examples of Driver Manipulation Attacks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🔹 <strong>HP Audio Driver Keylogger (2016):</strong> A debugging feature in HP’s audio drivers contained a hidden keylogger, capable of recording keystrokes. If exploited, this vulnerability could have exposed users to password theft and data breaches.</li>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Windows Compatibility Mode Exploitation (2015):</strong> Cybercriminals leveraged Windows’ Application Compatibility Shim Cache to bypass security features like UAC and gain unauthorized access.</li>
            <li>🔹 <strong>Malicious Kernel Drivers:</strong> Hackers have used compromised drivers to bypass antivirus protection by injecting malicious kernel-mode code. This technique is frequently seen in rootkits and advanced persistent threats (APTs).</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="driver-risks">
        <h2>Risks Associated with Driver Manipulation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🚨 <strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Attackers can use compromised drivers to steal sensitive data and infiltrate secure environments.</li>
            <li>🚨 <strong>System Instability:</strong> Modified drivers often introduce bugs or vulnerabilities, leading to frequent crashes, blue screens, or performance issues.</li>
            <li>🚨 <strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> A manipulated driver can grant an attacker administrator or kernel-level access, allowing them to take full control of the system.</li>
            <li>🚨 <strong>Backdoor for Further Attacks:</strong> Once a driver is compromised, it can be used as an entry point for installing additional malware or executing ransomware attacks.</li>
            <li>🚨 <strong>Bypassing Security Features:</strong> Manipulated drivers can disable antivirus tools, firewall protections, or monitoring systems, making it easier for attackers to operate undetected.</li>
        </ul>
