    <h1>MITRE ATT&CK Framework: Understanding Cyber Threats</h1>
    
    <h2>What is MITRE ATT&CK?</h2>
    <p>MITRE ATT&CK is a globally recognized knowledge base that documents cybercriminal behaviors, tactics, and techniques. It helps organizations detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats by understanding how attackers operate.</p>
    
    <p>This framework enables security teams to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simulate cyberattacks for testing defenses.</li>
        <li>Strengthen security policies and incident response strategies.</li>
        <li>Optimize security tools like SIEM, XDR, SOAR, and UEBA for better threat detection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Created by MITRE Corporation, a nonprofit, ATT&CK is continually updated with contributions from cybersecurity experts worldwide.</p>
    
    <h2>How MITRE ATT&CK is Structured</h2>
    <p>MITRE ATT&CK organizes cyberattack techniques into three primary matrices, covering different digital environments:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enterprise Matrix</strong> – Covers attacks on IT infrastructure (Windows, Linux, MacOS, cloud, networks, and containers).</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Matrix</strong> – Focuses on threats targeting iOS and Android devices.</li>
        <li><strong>ICS Matrix</strong> – Addresses cyber threats in industrial control systems (factories, utilities, and transportation).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>MITRE ATT&CK Tactics & Techniques</h2>
    <h3>Tactics: What Attackers Aim to Do</h3>
    <p>Each cyberattack progresses through various tactics, representing the adversary’s objectives. Some key tactics include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reconnaissance</strong> – Collecting information on a target.</li>
        <li><strong>Initial Access</strong> – Gaining entry through phishing, exploits, or credentials.</li>
        <li><strong>Execution</strong> – Running malicious code on the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Privilege Escalation</strong> – Gaining higher-level access (e.g., from user to admin).</li>
        <li><strong>Lateral Movement</strong> – Spreading within the network to access critical resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Exfiltration</strong> – Stealing or transferring sensitive data.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact</strong> – Destroying or corrupting data and systems.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Techniques: How Attackers Achieve Their Goals</h3>
    <p>Techniques define specific methods used to execute tactics. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spear Phishing (Initial Access)</strong> – Sending targeted emails with malicious links.</li>
        <li><strong>Process Injection (Defense Evasion)</strong> – Hiding malware in legitimate processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Brute Force (Credential Access)</strong> – Cracking passwords through repeated login attempts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each technique is linked to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Real-world examples of how attackers use it.</li>
        <li>Mitigation strategies such as firewalls, endpoint protection, and access controls.</li>
        <li>Detection methods using logs and system monitoring.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>MITRE ATT&CK Use Cases</h2>
    <p>Organizations use ATT&CK for various security operations, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Threat Detection & Incident Response</strong> – Helps security teams analyze alerts and prioritize threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Threat Hunting</strong> – Guides proactive searches for hidden threats in the network.</li>
        <li><strong>Red Teaming & Penetration Testing</strong> – Enables security professionals to simulate attacks and test defenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Gap Analysis</strong> – Assesses weaknesses in cybersecurity defenses.</li>
        <li><strong>SOC Maturity Assessments</strong> – Evaluates the efficiency of security operations centers.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>MITRE ATT&CK vs. Cyber Kill Chain</h2>
    <p>While both models analyze cyberattacks, Cyber Kill Chain focuses on a linear sequence of attack stages, assuming stopping one step can break the attack. In contrast, MITRE ATT&CK provides a flexible, detailed framework for identifying and mitigating individual tactics at any stage of an attack.</p>
    
    <h2>MITRE ATT&CK Navigator</h2>
    <p>MITRE provides ATT&CK Navigator, an open-source tool for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Searching and visualizing attack techniques.</li>
        <li>Comparing threats used by different cybercriminal groups.</li>
        <li>Identifying defenses against specific attack methods.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This tool can be accessed online or downloaded for local use.</p>
