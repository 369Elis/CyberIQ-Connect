        <h1>Understanding Security Policies in Cybersecurity</h1>
        <p>In today’s digital landscape, security breaches pose a significant threat to organizations. The cost of cyber incidents varies depending on how well an organization implements and enforces security policies. Establishing strong cybersecurity policies is essential for protecting sensitive data, ensuring compliance, and mitigating risks.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="policy">
        <h2>What Is an Information Security Policy?</h2>
        <p>An Information Security Policy (ISP) is a strategic document that defines an organization’s security principles and objectives. It provides a structured framework that outlines security expectations for employees, IT teams, and management.</p>

        <p>Unlike technical security measures, ISPs do not mandate specific technologies or tools. Instead, they:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Establish rules and responsibilities for data protection.</li>
            <li>✔ Define security best practices across the organization.</li>
            <li>✔ Set guidelines for compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Examples of ISP Requirements:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Encryption of company data stored on employee devices.</li>
            <li>✔ Strict access control for confidential business information.</li>
            <li>✔ Regular security training for staff to prevent cyber threats.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="policy-types">
        <h2>Three Primary Types of Cybersecurity Policies</h2>
        <div class="policy-grid">
            <div class="policy-card">
                <h3>1. Organizational Security Policies</h3>
                <p>✅ <strong>Purpose:</strong> Establishes broad security objectives and compliance requirements.</p>
                <p>✅ <strong>Scope:</strong> Covers all employees, departments, and IT infrastructure.</p>
                <p>✅ <strong>Impact:</strong> Guides the development of other security policies within the organization.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="policy-card">
                <h3>2. System-Specific Security Policies</h3>
                <p>✅ <strong>Purpose:</strong> Defines security measures tailored to individual systems.</p>
                <p>✅ <strong>Scope:</strong> Covers databases, cloud platforms, customer portals, and internal software.</p>
                <p>✅ <strong>Impact:</strong> Establishes technical security controls for each system.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="policy-card">
                <h3>3. Issue-Specific Security Policies</h3>
                <p>✅ <strong>Purpose:</strong> Focuses on particular cybersecurity risks (e.g., phishing, malware, ransomware).</p>
                <p>✅ <strong>Scope:</strong> Applies to both employees and IT systems to reduce vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p>✅ <strong>Impact:</strong> Enhances defensive measures against evolving threats.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="security-areas">
        <h2>Key Cybersecurity Areas Covered in Security Policies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ <strong>Physical Security:</strong> Restricts access to data centers and secure areas.</li>
            <li>✔ <strong>Data Retention & Storage:</strong> Defines storage durations and backup policies.</li>
            <li>✔ <strong>Encryption & Data Protection:</strong> Requires end-to-end encryption for sensitive data.</li>
            <li>✔ <strong>Access Control & Authentication:</strong> Enforces role-based access control (RBAC) and MFA.</li>
            <li>✔ <strong>Employee Security Awareness Training:</strong> Educates staff on phishing, malware, and cyber threats.</li>
            <li>✔ <strong>Risk Management & Threat Mitigation:</strong> Conducts security assessments and monitors threats.</li>
            <li>✔ <strong>Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery:</strong> Develops contingency plans for cyberattacks.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="compliance">
        <h2>Why Compliance With Security Policies Is Essential</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Reduces exposure to cyber threats such as hacking, phishing, and ransomware.</li>
            <li>✔ Meets regulatory obligations (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, NIST).</li>
            <li>✔ Prevents costly data breaches and legal penalties.</li>
            <li>✔ Ensures all employees follow security best practices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Organizations that fail to enforce security policies increase their vulnerability to cyber incidents and financial losses.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="guidelines">
        <h2>Security Guidelines vs. Security Policies & Standards</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ <strong>Security Policies →</strong> Define security principles and objectives (mandatory).</li>
            <li>✔ <strong>Security Standards →</strong> Set technical requirements for security implementation.</li>
            <li>✔ <strong>Security Guidelines →</strong> Provide best practices and recommendations (flexible).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While security policies and standards must be followed, guidelines allow for adaptation based on emerging threats and technology changes.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="industry-standards">
        <h2>Security Baselines & Industry Standards</h2>
        <p>Security baselines define minimum security requirements that all IT systems must follow.</p>
        <h3>Common Cybersecurity Standards:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ <strong>NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)</strong> – Best practices for security controls.</li>
            <li>✔ <strong>ISO/IEC 27001</strong> – Global information security management framework.</li>
            <li>✔ <strong>PCI-DSS</strong> – Protects credit card transactions from fraud.</li>
            <li>✔ <strong>GDPR & CCPA</strong> – Regulates data privacy and consumer protection laws.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Following recognized security frameworks strengthens an organization’s cybersecurity posture.</p>
