        <h1>Incident Response Plan (IRP): A Guide to Cybersecurity Preparedness</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="intro">
        <p>An Incident Response Plan (IRP) is a critical document that defines how an organization prepares for, responds to, and recovers from cybersecurity incidents. It ensures that roles and responsibilities are clearly outlined and provides structured guidance for handling potential threats efficiently.</p>
        <p>A well-developed IRP is approved by senior leadership and is essential for minimizing damage, maintaining trust, and ensuring business continuity in the event of a security breach.</p>

    <section class="before-incident">
        <h2>Before a Cybersecurity Incident</h2>
        <p>Preparation is key to ensuring a swift and effective response to cyber threats. Organizations should implement proactive security measures to reduce the risk of an incident and ensure readiness when one occurs.</p>

        <h3>1. Train Employees</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Employees should understand their role in cybersecurity and know how to report suspicious activity.</li>
            <li>✔ Encourage a security-first culture by rewarding employees who proactively report threats.</li>
            <li>✔ Avoid penalizing false alarms—encouraging vigilance is more important.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Consult Legal Experts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Work with an attorney to ensure that your IRP complies with legal and regulatory requirements.</li>
            <li>✔ Your attorney may provide specific guidance on engaging with law enforcement, vendors, and incident response teams.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Establish Key Relationships</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Meet with your CISA regional team to understand available cybersecurity resources.</li>
            <li>✔ Build relationships with local law enforcement (e.g., FBI, police) before an incident occurs.</li>
            <li>✔ Identify external cybersecurity firms that can assist in investigating breaches.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Ensure Communication Resilience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Print copies of the IRP and key contact lists—email and internal systems may be inaccessible during a cyberattack.</li>
            <li>✔ Establish alternative communication channels in case primary systems are compromised.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Define Stakeholder Roles & Responsibilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Determine who needs to be informed in case of an incident (e.g., executives, investors, partners).</li>
            <li>✔ Assign responsibilities for technical investigation, legal response, and public communication.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Conduct Regular Reviews & Simulations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Review and update the IRP quarterly to reflect new threats and organizational changes.</li>
            <li>✔ Run attack simulations (tabletop exercises) to test team preparedness and improve response efficiency.</li>
            <li>✔ Prepare pre-drafted press statements for potential cyber incidents to avoid rushed responses.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="during-incident">
        <h2>During a Cybersecurity Incident</h2>
        <p>Once a security breach is identified, a coordinated response is essential to contain the damage and restore operations.</p>

        <h3>1. Assign an Incident Manager (IM)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ The IM oversees the response effort, ensuring clear communication and efficient execution.</li>
            <li>✔ They monitor timelines to prevent delays caused by panic or time distortion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Assign a Technical Manager (TM)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ The TM leads the technical investigation, determining how the attack occurred and coordinating mitigation efforts.</li>
            <li>✔ They work with internal security teams and external cybersecurity experts to resolve the incident.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Assign a Communications Manager (CM)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ The CM manages external communication, including press inquiries and social media updates.</li>
            <li>✔ They ensure that the organization's message remains clear and controlled, preventing misinformation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Contain & Mitigate the Threat</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Isolate affected systems to prevent further compromise.</li>
            <li>✔ Identify the attack vector (e.g., phishing, ransomware, insider threat) and deploy countermeasures.</li>
            <li>✔ Monitor for secondary attacks—some cybercriminals launch additional threats after an initial breach.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="after-incident">
        <h2>After a Cybersecurity Incident</h2>
        <p>Post-incident analysis is crucial for learning from mistakes and strengthening security to prevent future breaches.</p>

        <h3>1. Conduct a Retrospective (Postmortem) Meeting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ The Incident Manager leads the review of the incident timeline.</li>
            <li>✔ Encourage open discussion without blame—most breaches result from systemic weaknesses, not individual errors.</li>
            <li>✔ Evaluate people, processes, and technologies to identify areas for improvement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Update Security Policies & Procedures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Use insights from the retrospective meeting to enhance security policies and patch vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>✔ Implement new security controls based on the lessons learned.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Communicate Findings to Employees</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Transparency fosters trust—sharing insights with staff reinforces a culture of security awareness.</li>
            <li>✔ Ensure that employees understand new security protocols and why they matter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Strengthen Future Cyber Resilience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Regularly test and refine the IRP to adapt to emerging threats.</li>
            <li>✔ Invest in continuous employee cybersecurity training to reduce human error risks.</li>
            <li>✔ Deploy advanced threat detection and response tools to improve security monitoring.</li>
        </ul>
