    <h1>Business Continuity for Operations: A Practical Guide</h1>
    <p>In today’s unpredictable world, organizations must be prepared to maintain critical operations despite disruptions. Whether it’s a natural disaster, cyberattack, or supply chain failure, a well-structured business continuity plan ensures that essential functions continue, minimizing financial losses and reputational damage.</p>
    
    <h2>What Is Business Continuity for Operations?</h2>
    <p>Business continuity for operations is the ability of an organization to keep essential business functions running during and after a disruption. This is not just about having a backup plan—it’s about embedding resilience into every aspect of your operations, so your team can respond effectively when unexpected events occur.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Business Continuity Matters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial losses:</strong> Lost revenue, penalties, and increased recovery costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Reputational damage:</strong> Customers lose trust when a business is unprepared.</li>
        <li><strong>Operational disruption:</strong> Delayed deliveries, service failures, and workforce disarray.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory penalties:</strong> Non-compliance with legal or industry regulations.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Key Components of Business Continuity Planning</h2>
    <h3>1. Business Impact Analysis (BIA) – Identifying Priorities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify mission-critical operations that keep the business running.</li>
        <li>Assess financial and operational risks of downtime.</li>
        <li>Establish recovery time objectives (RTOs) for restoring services.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Risk Assessment – Understanding Threats</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify natural disasters, cyber threats, infrastructure failures, and supply chain vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Analyze the impact of each risk on operations.</li>
        <li>Develop mitigation strategies to reduce risks.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Continuity Planning – Building a Resilient Framework</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Define roles and responsibilities.</li>
        <li>Establish alternate work arrangements.</li>
        <li>Plan for data backup and recovery.</li>
        <li>Maintain supply chain redundancy.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>4. Testing & Training – Making the Plan Work</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Conduct tabletop exercises.</li>
        <li>Perform live drills.</li>
        <li>Train employees to follow crisis communication protocols.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Key Areas of Operational Resilience</h2>
    <h3>1. Leadership Succession – Keeping Decision-Making on Track</h3>
