      <h1>What is a Keylogger?</h1>
      <p>
        A keylogger, short for <strong>keystroke logger</strong>, is a type of
        spyware—either software-based or hardware-based—that records every
        keystroke typed on a keyboard. The collected data is then sent to a
        hacker, often through a
        <strong>command-and-control (C2) server</strong>, allowing them to steal
        usernames, passwords, financial details, and other sensitive
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cybercriminals often use keyloggers to gain
        <strong>unauthorized access</strong> to online accounts, banking
        systems, and secure networks. Because keyloggers operate silently in the
        background, they can go undetected for long periods, making them a
        significant cybersecurity threat.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="types-of-keyloggers">
      <h2>Types of Keyloggers</h2>
      <p>
        Keyloggers come in two primary forms:
        <strong>software-based</strong> and <strong>hardware-based</strong>.
        Both serve the same purpose—capturing keystrokes—but they differ in how
        they are installed and how they collect data.
      </p>

      <h3>🔹 Software Keyloggers</h3>
      <p>
        Software keyloggers are malicious programs that silently install
        themselves on a device, recording every keystroke typed. These are the
        most common and dangerous type of keyloggers because they can spread
        across multiple systems.
      </p>

      <h4>How Software Keyloggers Work</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1️⃣ Infection</strong> – A user unknowingly installs a
          keylogger by downloading compromised software, clicking on a malicious
          link, or opening an infected email attachment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2️⃣ Keystroke Monitoring</strong> – Once installed, the
          keylogger operates in the background, tracking every keystroke entered
          on the system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3️⃣ Data Transmission</strong> – The stolen keystrokes are sent
          to the hacker remotely, often through encrypted communication
          channels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4️⃣ Credential Theft</strong> – Hackers analyze the collected
          data to extract login credentials, banking details, and personal
          information.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>💡 Common Risks of Software Keyloggers</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          🚨 <strong>Financial Theft</strong> – Hackers can steal banking
          credentials and execute unauthorized transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          🚨 <strong>Account Takeover</strong> – Cybercriminals can hijack
          emails, social media, or business accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
          🚨 <strong>Identity Theft</strong> – Stolen personal information can
          be used for fraudulent activities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🔹 Hardware Keyloggers</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike software keyloggers, hardware keyloggers require
        <strong>physical access</strong> to the victim’s device. These small,
        discreet devices plug into a USB port or keyboard connection to
        intercept and record keystrokes.
      </p>

      <h4>How Hardware Keyloggers Work</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1️⃣ Installation</strong> – The attacker physically connects a
          keylogging device to the victim’s computer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2️⃣ Stealth Monitoring</strong> – The keylogger records every
          keystroke and stores the data internally. Unlike software keyloggers,
          it does not transmit data remotely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3️⃣ Data Retrieval</strong> – The hacker must physically
          retrieve the device to access the recorded keystrokes or, in some
          cases, extract data via Wi-Fi-enabled keyloggers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>💡 Common Risks of Hardware Keyloggers</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          🚨 <strong>Corporate Espionage</strong> – Attackers can steal
          confidential company data.
        </li>
        <li>
          🚨 <strong>Undetectable Threats</strong> – Hardware keyloggers do not
          rely on software, making them harder to detect with traditional
          security tools.
        </li>
        <li>
          🚨 <strong>Network Security Risks</strong> – Stolen credentials can
          grant hackers access to entire corporate networks.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Protect Yourself from Keyloggers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          🔹 <strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong> – Even if
          a keylogger captures your password, MFA adds an extra layer of
          security, preventing unauthorized access.
        </li>
        <li>
          🔹 <strong>Regularly Scan for Malware</strong> – Use anti-keylogger
          software and endpoint security tools to detect and remove threats.
        </li>
        <li>
          🔹 <strong>Avoid Suspicious Downloads</strong> – Only download
          software from trusted sources to prevent malware infections.
        </li>
        <li>
          🔹 <strong>Monitor Physical Access</strong> – Prevent unauthorized
          access to your computer to reduce the risk of hardware keyloggers
          being installed.
        </li>
        <li>
          🔹 <strong>Use On-Screen Keyboards</strong> – Virtual keyboards can
          help mitigate keystroke tracking risks in high-threat environments.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By staying vigilant and implementing strong security measures, you can
        significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to keyloggers and
        protect your sensitive data from cybercriminals.
