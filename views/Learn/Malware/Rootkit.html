      <h2>What is a Rootkit?</h2>
      <p>
        A rootkit is a type of malware that gives hackers deep access
        and control over a compromised system. Unlike regular malware,
        rootkits are designed to stay hidden, making them one of the most
        difficult cyber threats to detect and remove.
      </p>
      <p>Rootkits can be used for various malicious activities, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          📌 Stealing sensitive data, including passwords and financial
          information.
        </li>
        <li>
          📌 Disabling security software, making the system more vulnerable.
        </li>
        <li>
          📌 Installing additional malware, such as ransomware or
          keyloggers.
        </li>
        <li>
          📌 Turning infected systems into botnets, used for cyberattacks.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="how-rootkits-work">
      <h2>How Rootkits Work</h2>
      <p>
        Rootkits don’t spread on their own; hackers install them using various
        attack methods, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ✅ Phishing Attacks: Tricking users into downloading a disguised
          rootkit.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ Software Vulnerabilities: Exploiting weaknesses in unpatched
          software.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ Bundled Malware: Hiding within seemingly harmless downloads
          (e.g., PDFs, pirated apps).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once installed, rootkits bury themselves deep into the system, often
        below the operating system, allowing them to intercept commands,
        manipulate files, and operate undetected.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="types-of-rootkits">
      <h2>Types of Rootkits</h2>
      <p>
        Rootkits come in different forms, each designed to target specific parts
        of a system:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          🔹 Hardware or Firmware Rootkits Target the BIOS, hard drive,
          or router, making them nearly impossible to remove.
        </li>
        <li>
          🔹 Bootloader Rootkits Replace the bootloader, activating
          the rootkit before the operating system fully loads.
        </li>
        <li>
          🔹 Memory Rootkits Reside in RAM, using system resources for
          malicious activity. Disappears after a reboot.
        </li>
        <li>
          🔹 Application Rootkits Infect everyday programs like Notepad
          or Microsoft Office, running in the background undetected.
        </li>
        <li>
          🔹 Kernel Mode Rootkits Infect the core of the operating
          system (kernel), giving hackers full control.
        </li>
        <li>
          🔹 Virtual Rootkits Run below the operating system as a
          virtual machine, making them extremely difficult to detect.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="protection">
      <h2>How to Protect Against Rootkits</h2>
      <p>Preventing rootkits requires strong cybersecurity measures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ✅ Keep Software Updated Install security patches to fix
          vulnerabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ Use a Trusted Antivirus Modern security tools can detect
          rootkits before they install.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ Avoid Suspicious Downloads Do not download from untrusted
          sources or third-party stores.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Adds an extra layer
          of security against unauthorized access.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ Monitor System Behavior Unexpected slowdowns, crashes, or
          strange processes could indicate a rootkit infection.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ Run a Rootkit Scanner Tools like Malwarebytes
          Anti-Rootkit or Kaspersky TDSSKiller can detect hidden rootkits.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Famous Rootkit Examples: Real-World Cyber Threats</h2>
      <p>
        Rootkits have been used in some of the most
        <strong>sophisticated cyberattacks</strong> in history, often linked to
        <strong>state-sponsored cyber warfare</strong> and
        <strong>espionage campaigns</strong>. Below are two of the most
        notorious rootkit-based threats that have made headlines worldwide.
      </p>

      <div class="rootkit-example">
        <h3>🛑 Stuxnet: The Cyberweapon That Changed Warfare</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most infamous rootkits ever discovered,
          <strong>Stuxnet</strong> was a highly sophisticated computer worm that
          came to light in <strong>2010</strong>, though its development is
          believed to have started around <strong>2005</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4>💻 What Did Stuxnet Do?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>💻 <strong>Target:</strong> Iran’s nuclear program</li>
          <li>
            🎯 <strong>Goal:</strong> Disrupt uranium enrichment by damaging
            centrifuges
          </li>
          <li>
            🎭 <strong>How It Worked:</strong> Stuxnet hijacked industrial
            control systems (ICS) and caused the centrifuges to malfunction
            while reporting normal operation data to monitoring systems.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>🔍 Who Created It?</h4>
        <p>
          While no country officially took responsibility,
          <strong>cybersecurity experts widely believe</strong> that Stuxnet was
          <strong>jointly developed by the United States and Israel</strong>
          under a secret operation known as <strong>Olympic Games</strong>. It
          is considered the
          <strong>first cyberweapon designed to cause physical damage</strong>
          to a nation’s infrastructure.
        </p>

        <h4>⚠️ Why It’s Dangerous:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            🚨 First known cyberattack targeting industrial control systems.
          </li>
          <li>💡 Highly complex and difficult to detect.</li>
          <li>🌍 Changed the landscape of modern cyber warfare.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="rootkit-example">
        <h3>🔷 Flame: The Silent Cyber Espionage Tool</h3>
        <p>
          Discovered in <strong>2012</strong>, <strong>Flame</strong> is another
          <strong>highly advanced rootkit</strong> primarily used for
          <strong>cyber espionage</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4>🖥️ How Did Flame Work?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>🔹 Monitor internet traffic and steal sensitive data.</li>
          <li>🔹 Take screenshots of the infected device.</li>
          <li>🔹 Activate microphones to record conversations.</li>
          <li>
            🔹 Log every keystroke, capturing passwords and confidential
            messages.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>🔍 Who Was Behind Flame?</h4>
        <p>
          The origin of Flame remains <strong>unknown</strong>, but researchers
          believe it was part of a larger
          <strong>state-sponsored cyber campaign</strong> targeting
          <strong>Middle Eastern governments and organizations</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4>🌍 Key Findings:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            🔀 Flame was designed with a
            <strong>complex command-and-control system</strong> spread across
            <strong>80 servers in three continents</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            👀 It remained <strong>undetected for several years</strong>,
            demonstrating the effectiveness of stealthy rootkit malware.
          </li>
          <li>
            💻 Some experts speculate that
            <strong>Flame and Stuxnet were connected</strong>, as they shared
            <strong>similar coding techniques</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>⚠️ Why It’s Dangerous:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            🔎 One of the most sophisticated cyber espionage tools ever found.
          </li>
          <li>👁️‍🗨️ Capable of long-term surveillance without detection.</li>
          <li>💾 Designed to extract vast amounts of sensitive information.</li>
        </ul>
