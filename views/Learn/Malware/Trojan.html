      <section class="intro">
        <p>
          A **Trojan Horse Virus** is a type of **malware** that disguises
          itself as a harmless or legitimate program to trick users into
          installing it. Attackers often use **social engineering** to embed
          **malicious code** into software, emails, or downloads, allowing them
          to gain access to a system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine receiving a **gift-wrapped box** that looks harmless, but once
          you open it, **a thief jumps out and takes control of your house**.
          That’s how a **Trojan virus** works—pretending to be useful software
          while secretly infecting your system.
        </p>

      <section class="how-it-works">
        <h2>⚙️ How Does a Trojan Work?</h2>
        <p>
          A Trojan typically arrives as an **email attachment** or a
          **free-to-download file**, appearing safe but containing **hidden
          malware**. Once installed, it can execute harmful tasks such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            🔓 **Creating a backdoor** for attackers to access the system.
          </li>
          <li>👀 **Spying on user activity.**</li>
          <li>
            🔑 **Stealing sensitive data** like passwords and financial
            information.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Signs of an active Trojan infection include **unexpected changes to
          system settings, slow performance, or strange background processes
          running without your knowledge**.

      <section class="history">
        <h2>🏛️ History of the Trojan Horse</h2>
        <p>
          The term **"Trojan Horse"** comes from **ancient Greek mythology**,
          specifically Virgil’s *Aeneid* and Homer’s *Odyssey*. In the legend,
          the Greeks, unable to breach the **walls of Troy** after a decade-long
          siege, used **deception**. They built a **massive wooden horse** and
          presented it as a **gift** to the Trojans. Unaware of the trick, the
          Trojans brought it inside their city walls. Hidden inside the horse,
          **Greek soldiers** waited until nightfall, then emerged, opened the
          gates for their army, and **conquered Troy from within**.
        </p>
        <p>
          This story perfectly parallels how **Trojan Horse viruses work** in
          cybersecurity. Here’s why:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            🛡️ **Bypassing Strong Defenses** – Like the original **Trojan
            Horse**, a Trojan virus sneaks past **system security measures**.
          </li>
          <li>
            🎭 **Appearing Legitimate** – The **wooden horse** seemed like a
            **harmless gift**, just as a Trojan virus often disguises itself as
            **safe or useful software**.
          </li>
          <li>
            🕹 **Gaining Control** – Once inside Troy, the Greek soldiers **took
            control** of the city. Similarly, a Trojan virus can **take control
            of a computer**, leaving it open to further attacks.
          </li>
        </ul>
