      <h2>What is Adware?</h2>
      <p>
        Adware is a type of **software** that displays unwanted advertisements
        on your device, usually as a way for its creator to make money. These
        ads can appear inside apps, during software installation, or while
        browsing the internet.
      </p>
      <p>While some adware is relatively harmless, other versions can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          📌 **Track your browsing habits** and collect data on your online
          activity.
        </li>
        <li>
          📌 **Overload your device** with pop-ups and banners, slowing it down.
        </li>
        <li>
          📌 **Redirect your browser** to unsafe websites, exposing you to
          malware.
        </li>
        <li>
          📌 **Install additional software** without permission, including
          spyware or Trojan viruses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Adware often gets installed accidentally when users download **free
        software or games**. Some versions are even programmed to **update
        themselves**, making them harder to detect and remove.
      </p>

    <section id="what-is-spyware">
      <h2>What is Spyware?</h2>
      <p>
        Spyware is a far more **dangerous type of malware** that runs **silently
        in the background**, collecting **your private information** without
        your knowledge. Unlike adware, which focuses on displaying ads, spyware
        is **designed to steal sensitive data and send it to a hacker**.
      </p>
      <p>Cybercriminals use spyware to gather details such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔹 **Browsing history and online activity**</li>
        <li>🔹 **Login credentials**, including usernames and passwords</li>
        <li>
          🔹 **Financial details**, such as credit card numbers and banking
          information
        </li>
        <li>🔹 **Private business or personal data**</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One of the most dangerous forms of spyware is a **keylogger**, which
        records **every keystroke you type**—including passwords, emails, and
        private messages. Because spyware **operates undetected**, it can
        **compromise your data for months**, leading to identity theft,
        financial fraud, or unauthorized access to your accounts.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="difference">
      <h2>How is Adware Different from Spyware?</h2>
      <p>
        Although both **adware and spyware** can infect your device without your
        consent, they serve different purposes and pose varying levels of risk:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          🔹 **Adware** is designed to **generate revenue** by displaying
          unwanted ads. It often **tracks your browsing habits, redirects your
          browser**, and sometimes installs extra software without permission.
          While adware can be **annoying**, some versions also contain spyware
          that **compromises your privacy**.
        </li>
        <li>
          🔹 **Spyware**, on the other hand, is much more **dangerous** because
          it’s designed to **steal personal and financial information**. Unlike
          adware, spyware **doesn’t focus on ads**—it tracks **keystrokes,
          monitors browsing activity, and steals login credentials**.
          Cybercriminals use spyware for **identity theft, fraud, and corporate
          espionage**.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While adware can **slow down your device** and create a frustrating user
        experience, **spyware is a serious security risk** that can result in
        major privacy breaches.

      <h2>How to Protect Yourself from Adware and Spyware</h2>
      <p>
        To keep your devices safe from **adware, spyware, and other cyber
        threats**, follow these security tips:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ✅ **Use an Ad Blocker** – Install a trusted **ad-blocking extension**
          in your browser to limit unwanted ads and tracking.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ **Keep Your Software Updated** – Updates help **patch security
          holes** that malware can exploit.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ **Be Cautious with Free Software** – Download apps only from
          **reputable sources** and always read the **installation terms**
          before clicking “Agree.”
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ **Enable Real-Time Antivirus Protection** – A good **anti-malware
          tool** can detect and remove threats before they cause damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ **Turn on Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Even if spyware
          steals your password, **MFA adds an extra security layer** to prevent
          unauthorized access.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ **Watch Out for Phishing Attacks** – Avoid clicking **suspicious
          links or email attachments**, as they can install spyware on your
          device.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        💡 Advanced cybersecurity tools, like those from **Cisco, Norton, or
        Bitdefender**, can detect, block, and remove **spyware, adware, and
        other types of malware** used in cyberattacks.
