      <h2>What is a Bot?</h2>
      <p>
        A **bot** is a type of software that performs **automated tasks** on the
        internet. These tasks are often **simple, repetitive, and
        time-consuming**, making bots much faster and more efficient than humans
        at handling them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, **Googlebot**, Google's web-crawling bot, scans and indexes
        websites across the internet. While a human could technically do the
        same thing‚Äîcopying and organizing web data‚Äî**a bot can accomplish this
        at an exponentially faster rate with higher accuracy**.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bots are commonly used for **search engine indexing, customer support
        chatbots, and workflow automation**. However, **not all bots are
        beneficial**‚Äîcybercriminals often exploit them for malicious activities.
      </p>

    <section id="what-is-botnet">
      <h2>What is a Botnet?</h2>
      <p>
        A **botnet** (short for "**robot network**") is a **network of
        compromised devices**‚Äîincluding **computers, smartphones, and IoT
        gadgets**‚Äîthat have been hijacked by a hacker. The individual
        controlling these infected devices is known as a **bot herder**.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once malware infects these devices, they become **"zombies"**, meaning
        they can be remotely controlled **without their owner‚Äôs knowledge**.
        Because infected devices still function normally, users often don‚Äôt
        realize they are part of a botnet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cybercriminals use botnets to **execute large-scale attacks**, often
        leveraging thousands or even millions of hijacked devices at once.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="botnet-attack">
      <h2>What is a Botnet Attack?</h2>
      <p>
        A **botnet attack** happens when hackers **leverage a botnet** to launch
        large-scale cyberattacks. Since botnets consist of **many infected
        devices**, they allow attackers to **amplify their attacks**, making
        them harder to stop.
      </p>
      <p>### **Common Uses of Botnets in Cybercrime**</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          üîπ **DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) Attacks** ‚Äì Overwhelming a
          target website or server with massive traffic, causing it to crash.
        </li>
        <li>
          üîπ **Massive Data Scraping** ‚Äì Extracting large amounts of information
          from websites **without permission**.
        </li>
        <li>
          üîπ **Credential Stuffing** ‚Äì Using stolen username-password pairs to
          attempt **unauthorized logins** on various platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          üîπ **Spam & Phishing Campaigns** ‚Äì Sending **large volumes of
          fraudulent emails** to trick users into clicking **malicious links**
          or **revealing personal information**.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some cybercriminals even **rent out botnets**, allowing people with
        **little to no technical knowledge** to launch cyberattacks for a price.
      </p>

    <section id="protection">
      <h2>How to Protect Yourself from Botnets</h2>
      <p>
        Millions of devices worldwide **are already infected** and being used
        for cybercrime without their owners knowing. Taking **preventative
        measures** is the best way to protect yourself.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ‚úÖ **Keep Your Software Updated** ‚Äì Regularly install **security
          updates and patches** to fix vulnerabilities that malware exploits.
        </li>
        <li>
          ‚úÖ **Use Strong, Unique Passwords** ‚Äì Avoid reusing passwords and
          enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to prevent unauthorized
          access.
        </li>
        <li>
          ‚úÖ **Be Cautious with Emails & Links** ‚Äì Avoid clicking **suspicious
          links** or downloading attachments from unknown sources.
        </li>
        <li>
          ‚úÖ **Install a Reliable Antivirus Program** ‚Äì A strong **security
          suite** can detect and remove malware before it takes control of your
          device.
        </li>
        <li>
          ‚úÖ **Secure Your Smart Devices** ‚Äì Change **default passwords** on IoT
          devices and **keep them updated** to prevent hackers from taking over.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Understanding **how botnets work** is the first step in defending
        against these hidden threats. By staying informed and practicing
        **strong security measures**, you can **help prevent your devices from
        being used in cyberattacks**.
