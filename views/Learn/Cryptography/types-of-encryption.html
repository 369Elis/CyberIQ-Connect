    <section>
        <p>Encryption is a fundamental security process that converts data into an unreadable format, ensuring only those with the correct decryption key can access the original information.</p>
        <p>In simple terms, encryption safeguards data from unauthorized access, making it useless to cybercriminals even if they manage to breach a system. It helps maintain privacy, verifies authenticity, and ensures data integrity by preventing alterations or tampering.</p>

        <h2>How Encryption Works</h2>
        <p>When converted, plain text like "Hello, world!" turns into an obscure sequence of symbols or characters. However, encryption follows a structured algorithm, meaning a recipient with the correct decryption key can restore the data to its original form.</p>
        <p>Hackers often attempt to break encryption through brute-force attacks, repeatedly trying different key combinations. With the rise of computing power, weaknesses in outdated encryption can be exploited.</p>
        <p>To ensure security, encryption applies to data in two forms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>At Rest:</strong> When stored in a database or device.</li>
            <li><strong>In Transit:</strong> While being transmitted between systems or users.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Encryption algorithms govern how plaintext transforms into ciphertext using specific formulas and keys. Common encryption techniques include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</li>
            <li>Blowfish</li>
            <li>Rivest Cipher (RC4, RC5, RC6)</li>
            <li>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</li>
            <li>Twofish</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Originally exclusive to governments, encryption is now a standard security measure for protecting both personal and corporate data.</p>

        <h2>Types of Encryption</h2>
        
        <h3>Symmetric Encryption</h3>
        <p>This method uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. It is fast and effective for securing large volumes of data but requires both parties to securely exchange the key beforehand.</p>
        <p>Popular symmetric encryption methods include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AES-128</li>
            <li>AES-192</li>
            <li>AES-256</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Asymmetric Encryption</h3>
        <p>Also known as public-key cryptography, this method utilizes two different keys: one public and one private. The public key encrypts the data, while the private key decrypts it. Since the public key can be shared openly, this method enhances security for online communications.</p>
        <p>Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols commonly use asymmetric encryption for securing website connections.</p>

        <h2>Key Encryption Techniques</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Encryption Standard (DES):</strong> A former encryption standard now considered outdated due to its susceptibility to brute-force attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Triple DES (3DES):</strong> An improved version of DES that applies encryption three times but is now largely obsolete.</li>
            <li><strong>RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):</strong> A widely used public-key encryption system for secure communications and VPNs.</li>
            <li><strong>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):</strong> A robust encryption method offering key sizes of 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit, ideal for securing sensitive data in databases and storage systems.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Cloud Encryption</h2>
        <p>Cloud service providers often encrypt data before storing it to enhance security. However, businesses must assess the provider’s encryption policies, as some only encrypt select fields like passwords or account numbers.</p>
        <p>Organizations needing greater control might use <strong>Bring Your Own Encryption (BYOE)</strong> to manage their own encryption keys, while others opt for <strong>Encryption as a Service (EaaS)</strong>, a cloud-based encryption solution.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)</h2>
        <p>E2EE ensures that only the intended sender and recipient can access the transmitted messages, preventing service providers from decrypting the content. Messaging platforms like WhatsApp use E2EE to enhance communication security.</p>

        <h2>Advantages of Encryption</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> Ensures confidential information remains protected, even in the event of a breach.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Helps businesses meet legal data protection requirements in industries like finance and healthcare.</li>
            <li><strong>Safe Web Browsing:</strong> Encrypts online activities to prevent unauthorized interception and data theft.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Privacy:</strong> Essential for securing personal and corporate information in online transactions, communication platforms, and cloud storage.</li>
        </ul>
