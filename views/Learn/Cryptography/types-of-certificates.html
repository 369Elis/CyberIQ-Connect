        <h2>Why Understanding Digital Certificates Matters</h2>
        <p>Digital certificates authenticate individuals, devices, and software, ensuring secure communication. As an organization expands, managing certificates becomes more complex.</p>
        <p>SSL/TLS certificates safeguard sensitive data during online transactions, while other types are used to sign code and protect IoT devices. Without proper oversight, weak certificate management poses serious cybersecurity threats.</p>

        <h2>Types of Digital Certificates</h2>
        
        <h3>SSL/TLS Certificates</h3>
        <p>These certificates establish encrypted connections between web browsers and servers, preventing unauthorized data interception.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Single Domain SSL:</strong> Secures one domain, ideal for basic websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Wildcard SSL:</strong> Covers a domain and its subdomains using a wildcard character (*).</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Domain SSL (SAN):</strong> Protects multiple domains within one certificate.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>SSL Validation Levels</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Domain Validation (DV):</strong> Confirms domain ownership but not business identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Organization Validation (OV):</strong> Verifies domain ownership and business details.</li>
            <li><strong>Extended Validation (EV):</strong> Provides the highest verification level for financial institutions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Code Signing Certificates</h3>
        <p>These verify the integrity and authenticity of software, ensuring it hasn’t been tampered with.</p>
        
        <h3>Email Encryption and Signing Certificates</h3>
        <p>These certificates secure email communication by encrypting messages and verifying the sender’s identity.</p>
        
        <h3>Client Authentication Certificates</h3>
        <p>Used for verifying users before granting access to a server or network, providing an additional security layer beyond passwords.</p>
        
        <h3>Document Signing Certificates</h3>
        <p>These digitally sign electronic documents, confirming authenticity and ensuring they haven’t been altered.</p>
        
        <h3>Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</h3>
        <p>VMCs display a trusted mark in the browser bar alongside an SSL certificate, verifying website ownership.</p>
        
        <h3>IoT Security Certificates</h3>
        <p>IoT devices rely on lightweight certificates to establish secure connections, preventing unauthorized access.</p>
        
        <h3>Ephemeral Certificates for DevOps</h3>
        <p>Designed for short-term use, ephemeral certificates facilitate secure communication during frequent software deployments.</p>
        
        <h3>Certificate Authority (CA) Certificates</h3>
        <p>CA certificates validate the identity of Certificate Authorities that issue digital certificates.</p>

        <h2>Managing the Certificate Lifecycle</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regularly Renewing SSL/TLS Certificates:</strong> Industry standards recommend renewing certificates annually.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintaining an Accurate Inventory:</strong> Tracking all active certificates prevents disruptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring Root of Trust (RoT) and Encryption Keys:</strong> Ensuring security through certificate monitoring.</li>
            <li><strong>Revoking Expired or Compromised Certificates:</strong> Decommissioning outdated certificates minimizes security risks.</li>
        </ul>
